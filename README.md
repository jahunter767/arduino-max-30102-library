# arduino-max-30102-library

This library was written with the intension of simplifying the library provided
by SparkFun [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MAX3010x_Sensor_Library)
as well as separate the i2c communication logic from the code to interact with
the module.

## TODO

1. explore reducing the memory requirements by
   1. finding an alternative to storing all those register masks
   2. using a bitfield to store a module's configuration and having logic to
      intelligently sends the relevant commands to apply the configuration
2. debug the algorithm to compute the heart rate
